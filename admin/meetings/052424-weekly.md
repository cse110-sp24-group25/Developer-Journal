### Weekly Review
Need to finalize pipeline before starting pushing to main, we can try to push homepage to main and see what kind of error we have, and try to get a better understanding of what is causing the trouble. We want to adjust the task lists because there are some known bugs that we noticed, so the homepage team is attempting to revamp the entire task lists to fix the bugs.
In terms of local storage, the team was able to store some of the important parts down, but it is having some bugs, we JavaScript team is also trying to revamp the LocalStorage functions in the javascript files.
