### Absent

## SWOT Analysis
### Strengths:
- Planned and designed before we implemented; spent significant time on this part before moving forward
- Splitting up into teams was efficient, more manageable
- Everyone carried their weight and was reliable
- Everyone had input and each opinion was considered
- Github pipeline and actions were done well
- Communication was great, within teams and between teams; utilizing Slack, Github comments, and in-person meetings

### Weaknesses
- Some unnecessary backtracking; ie implementing something, then refactoring, then re-implementing
- Messy Github repo; too many branches and issues
- Differing code style somewhat
- Pipeline was finalized a little late into the project

### Opportunities
- More structured pipeline
- Responsiveness of the website at smaller screens isnâ€™t great
- A universal search function for searching for past journal entries, tasks, etc.

### Threats
- Our storage system is fairly small; performance would slow down with upward scaling
- On slow, low-capability mobile phones, website slows down significantly
