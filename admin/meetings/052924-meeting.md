### Standup/General Announcements
Home page is done except for sizing of rating widget. Calendar only needs slight changes with coloring and sizing. Needs to implement tasks side bar.
Chris met with Smruthi, we should switch focus almost entirely to testing. The last time we can make changes to our product is end of week 10.

### Testing
Teams will begin to shift focus onto testing. Backend team still working on storage, but other teams will focus on puppeteering and e2e tests.

### Minimum Screen Size
Need to decide on a minumum screen size to allow users to still use the desktop app. Phone version is a no-go for now. 
Could posibly add some sort of implementation but highly unlikely.

### Reassign Teams
Need to redo the team structure for testing. Sonya, Kai, Kevin most comfortable with pipeline integration. 
We need unit tests, puppeteering, and integration into the pipeline.
